<p style="color:#cccccc">Good talk there, Programmers. Anyway, we are The Design Team and we are in charge of making the models for the game. Some of these models include the designing and modeling of buildings, characters, weapons, vehicles, and many more. We are open and happy to let you in if you are interested.

<p style="color:#cccccc">Hmm, quite a nice speech by programmers and designers. Ok, we are The Story Board guys. As our name says, we make up an enormous and exciting story for the game. We are the main idea of the game and if we have no story, the designers will not have anything to base their designs on, and the programmers will not have anything to base their programming on. So anyway, if you want to be a part of the foundation of this game making process, I suggest you join The Story Board Team because you will be excited. Also, if you want to join make sure you are ready to give us all you got because we need you and your ideas more than anything, cutie pie. ;)</p>

As the Audio Team, we are responsible for composing backgrounds and sound effects, and overseeing their implementation in the game.  Do you speak through music?  We would be glad to have you.  Before joining, it may be helpful to learn a little about the HTML5 WebAudio API.  Hear you soon ;)</p>
