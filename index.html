<a name="the-programming-team" class="anchor" href="#the-programming-team"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Programming Team</h3>

<p>Hello, we are the Programming Team and we are in charge of the coding the game. 
We make the game interactive through coding and we make sure that the tasks assigned to us have been fulfilled. 
If you want to be part of the Programming Team, make sure you are prepared to learn C++, because we use it a lot, and be ready to face any challenge as a warrior.</p>

<h3>
<a name="the-design-team" class="anchor" href="#the-design-team"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Design Team.</h3>

<p>Good talk there, programmers. 
Anyway, we are the Design Team and we are in charge of making the models for the game. 
Some of these models include buildings, characters, weapons, and vehicles. 
We are open and happy to let you in if you are interested. 
But before you join you need to be ready to learn how to use <b>Autodesk 3Ds Max</b> and <b>Sculptris Alpha 6</b>, because they will be essential for the modeling. See you soon.</p>

<h3>
<a name="the-story-board-team" class="anchor" href="#the-story-board-team"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Story Board Team</h3>

<p>Hmm, quite a nice speech by the programmers and designers. 
Ok, we are the Storyboard Team guys. 
As our name says, our job is to create an interesting and exciting story for the game. 
The story we create is the main idea of the game and if we have no story, the designers will not have anything to base their designs on, and the programmers will not have anything to base their programming on. 
Moving on, if you want to be a part of the foundation of this game making process, I suggest you join the Story Board Team today. 
Also, if you want to join make sure you are ready to give us all you've got, because we need you and your ideas more than anything, cutie pie. ;)</p>

<h3>
<a name="the-audio-team" class="anchor" href="#the-audio-team"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Audio Team</h3>

<p>We usually express ourselves through our music, but this time we'll have to use words.  
As the Audio Team, we are responsible for composing backgrounds and sound effects, and overseeing their implementation in the game.  
Do you speak through music?  We would be glad to have you.  
Before joining, it may be helpful to learn a little about the HTML5 WebAudio API.  Hear you soon ;)</p>
